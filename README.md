# [University of Leeds][1] Research Computing Website

This is the official repository of the Research Computing Team website from
the University of Leeds. It is built using GitHub pages and Jekyll and is
based on the [*Feeling Responsive*][2] theme.

You can find the site at [arcleeds.github.io](https://arcleeds.github.io)

## Website Structure Philosophy

The way this site has been structured looks to take advantage of Liquid syntax
to neatly manage page content without writing lots of HTML. You'll find most of the data
that makes up the content to this site within the \_data/ directory, with most of the files
in the pages directory just including the liquid syntax to load the data.

The blog, changlog and casestudies pages are in the blog format for this Jekyll template.
This means to add a post you need to add a new markdown file into the \_posts subdirectory
in the format of `yyyy-mm-dd-articleName-category`.
