The University of Leeds is committed to making its websites accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. Our plan of work to improve accessibility means, ultimately, you should be able to:

* Change colours, contrast levels and fonts.
* Zoom in up to 300% without losing access to content.
* Navigate most of the website using just a keyboard.
* Navigate most of the website using speech recognition software.
* Listen to most of the website using a screen reader.

We are also working to ensure that the language on our website as simple as possible to understand. 

Compliance status
-----------------

This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.

* Some headings, regions, lists, and tables are not coded appropriately. This doesn’t meet criterion 1.3.1 (info and relationships).
* The reading order and navigation order of all of our pages is not logical and intuitive. This doesn’t meet criterion 1.3.2 (meaningful sequence).
* Our pages aren’t always readable and functional when you zoom in to 200%; This doesn’t meet criterion 1.4.4 (resize text).
* Not all of our page functionality is available just through using a keyboard interface under some circumstances. This doesn’t meet criterion 2.1.1 (keyboard).

We have a plan to make sure our headings, tables, and lists are coded correctly, pages are zoomable without losing functionality, and that the navigation order of our pages makes sense and is keyboard accessible. We intend to resolve these issues as soon as possible.

How this website was tested
---------------------------

We assessed a selection of key pages against the WCAG 2.1 AA Standard based test model using a combination of user testing and automated tools.
