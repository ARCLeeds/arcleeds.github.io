Welcome to the University of Leeds' Research Computing Resource Guide!
IT Services provide a number of tools and services for both data storage and compute, Research Computing being the primary point of contact for research users.

## Finding the Right Computing Resources for Your Research

Whether you're working on small-scale analysis, developing complex simulations, or running intensive computations, we have a wide range of computing resources tailored to support your research.

This guide will help you navigate through various options, from individual devices to advanced High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. To find the most appropriate resource, consider these questions:

- Are you looking for something you can use immediately on your personal device?
- Do you need more power without the complexity of HPC systems?
- Are you running large-scale computations that require multi-node parallel processing?

*Use our Resource Roadmap below to discover the best solution for your research needs.*
