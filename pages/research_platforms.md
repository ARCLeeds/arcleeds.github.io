Welcome to the University of Leeds' Research Computing Resource Guide!
IT Services provide a number of tools and services for both data storage and compute, Research Computing being the primary point of contact for research users.

## Finding the Right Computing Resources for Your Research

Whether you're working on small-scale analysis, developing complex simulations, or running intensive computations, we have a wide range of computing resources tailored to support your research.

This guide will help you navigate through various options, from individual devices to advanced High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. To find the most appropriate resource, consider these questions:

- Are you looking for something you can use immediately on your personal device?
- Do you need more power without the complexity of HPC systems?
- Are you running large-scale computations that require multi-node parallel processing?

*Use our Resource Roadmap below to discover the best solution for your research needs.*

### Resource Roadmap

1. **Starting Small: Individual Device**
   - If you're just getting started or your computations are lightweight, you can easily begin on your laptop or desktop.
   - Ideal for initial code development, small data analysis, and non-intensive simulations.
2. **Need More Power? Try Shared Devices**
   - If your work is starting to slow down your individual device, consider using a cluster machine or Linux server.
   - These shared systems give you extra memory, CPU power, or GPU access without the complexity of an HPC queue. Great for testing and debugging.
3. **Cloud Solutions for Flexibility and Collaboration**
   - For collaborative projects, cloud resources offer flexible environments.
   - These are perfect for sharing work, developing in teams, and quickly testing your code without investing in hardware.
   - Unfortunately, most of the solutions are not supported by the university
4. **Need to Scale Up? Local HPC is the Next Step**
   - When your research requires heavy computation, high-end GPUs, or parallel processing, it’s time to consider our local (Tier 3) HPC resources like.
   - Get direct support from the Research Computing team and access systems tailored to your project’s needs.
5. **For the Largest Projects: External HPC**
   - For large, multi-node, or specialized GPU jobs, Tier-2 (Regional) and Tier-1 (National) HPC facilities offer matchless power and scale.
   - These external HPC systems are ideal for massive datasets, complex simulations, or GPU-heavy research.
