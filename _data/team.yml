      "Alex is a Research Software Engineer at the University of Leeds. Previously,
      he worked in Leeds Institute of Data Analytics as a Data Scientist intern on
      projects looking at automatically classifying police dispatch reports using natural language
      processing and developing methods for simulating police supply and demand. He has experience
      using Python and R to wrangle data, develop statistical models and implement and deploy
      interactive applications built ontop those models. He is evangelical about reproducible research
      especially through leveraging software development tools such as version control, CI/CD, documentation
      and testing to make code more open and more useful.
