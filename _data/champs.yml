  - name: Daniel Valdenegro
    bio: "
    Daniel Valdenegro is a PhD student in Computational Social Science at the University of Leeds and former Data Analyst 
    and Junior Researcher at the Social Psychology Lab of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. He is passionate 
    about data analysis and quantitative social research methodology, with experience working with R, Python and JavaScript.
     His research interests are in the use of ‘big data’ from digital sources -such as social media, IoT or just general 
     digital footprint- to model human behaviour. His current PhD project attempts to use the public digital footprint on 
     social media of populations that are undergoing periods of social unrest, to extract their general emotional pattern, 
     all this to build a predictive model of activism based on theses parameters.

  - name: Ben Hanson
    bio: "
      Ben is a computational biophysicist working in the School of Physics and Astronomy. 
      He's currently researching the multiscale formation and mechanical properties of globular protein hydrogels, 
      but is interested overall in how general physical models translate across the biological mesoscale. Part of
      his interest in the role of research software champion is in communicating to the scientific research 
      populace the overlap and differences between mathematics, computation and experimental science.
