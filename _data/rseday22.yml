      I joined the team after spending a year as a Data Scientist in Leeds Institute of Data Analytics and completing my lab based PhD before that.
      Being an RSE has allowed me to not only develop my software engineering skills but also help apply and advocate for best practice across research.
      This means the day job is incredibly varied from helping support researchers write code to model COVID-19, to helping configure software on the HPC systems 
      to delivering training course on version control using git.
      With the ever increasing number of researchers doing some form of computation as part of their work having a core team of RSEs who can provide expert advice and
      ensure researchers are exposed to cutting edge tools and techniques is critical to accelerating innovation at Leeds.

  - name: John Hodrien
    quote: "
    John is a Research Software Engineer working within the Research
    IT team at the University of Leeds. Starting life as a Computer Scientist at
    Leeds; he taught parallel programming (C/C++; MPI/pthreads); before becoming
    a researcher within the Visualisation and Virtual Reality research group;
    all within the School of Computing. In these research roles; he has developed
    systems for working with pathology data with high resolution display clusters;
    and worked on a number of research projects on e-Science/Grid Computing.
    More recent work within IT involved providing and supporting a range of
    predominantly Linux solutions to research and teaching within Engineering;
    and more recently John has been a leader of this provision for the whole University.
    <br>
    <br>
    John has worked with a number of languages such as C/C++; Java; and Fortran;
    along with associated toolchains like Git; and has a soft spot for
    configuration management tools like Puppet; which has been used to provide
    standard configuration and deployment of systems and solutions at Leeds.

    quote: "
    Patricia is a Research Software Engineer, focusing on Computational Mechanics, 
    at the University of Leeds. She has a PhD in Theoretical Physics and a Master 
    degree in Condensed Matter Physics. Her research focuses on the development of
    computational models that help to understand complex systems; initially focusing
    on phenomena such as the behaviour of fluids at nano‐scales and lately modelling
    emergence in spatio‐social systems. Previously, she worked as a Researcher in
    Simulating Urban Systems at the School of Geography (2019-2021), and before 
    joining the University of Leeds, Patricia also worked as an physics
    undergraduate professor at Federal Institute Catarinense-Brazil (2018-2019).

      I started programming for free and spontaneous pressure during my master's
      degree. At the time I was trying to model water on a rough surface and all
      I had access to was a patient supervisor and photocopies of very old
      programming books. I remember that after adding a feature to my code, it
      started to give the wrong result and I spent 4 (bloody) months trying to
      find the error (a wrong signal!!!). Today I know good practices and
      technologies that prevent errors like this from being a big problem, and
      one of the things I like most about being a RSE is being able to guide
      students and researchers so that they can produce science in a less painful
      way and with higher quality than I did.
      My wish for the future is for our team to be able to integrate more and more
      with students and researches and for our work to be increasingly impactful.
      I also hope that we can encourage and participate in a movement around
      open and reproducible research.
