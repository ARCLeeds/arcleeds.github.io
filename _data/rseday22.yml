      "Alex is a Research Software Engineer at the University of Leeds. Previously,
      he worked in Leeds Institute of Data Analytics as a Data Scientist intern on
      projects looking at automatically classifying police dispatch reports using natural language
      processing and developing methods for simulating police supply and demand. He has experience
      using Python and R to wrangle data, develop statistical models and implement and deploy
      interactive applications built ontop those models. He is evangelical about reproducible research
      especially through leveraging software development tools such as version control, CI/CD, documentation
      and testing to make code more open and more useful.

    John is a Research Software Engineer working within the Research
    IT team at the University of Leeds. Starting life as a Computer Scientist at
    Leeds; he taught parallel programming (C/C++; MPI/pthreads); before becoming
    a researcher within the Visualisation and Virtual Reality research group;
    all within the School of Computing. In these research roles; he has developed
    systems for working with pathology data with high resolution display clusters;
    and worked on a number of research projects on e-Science/Grid Computing.
    More recent work within IT involved providing and supporting a range of
    predominantly Linux solutions to research and teaching within Engineering;
    and more recently John has been a leader of this provision for the whole University.

    quote: "
    Patricia is a Research Software Engineer, focusing on Computational Mechanics, 
    at the University of Leeds. She has a PhD in Theoretical Physics and a Master 
    degree in Condensed Matter Physics. Her research focuses on the development of
    computational models that help to understand complex systems; initially focusing
    on phenomena such as the behaviour of fluids at nano‐scales and lately modelling
    emergence in spatio‐social systems. Previously, she worked as a Researcher in
    Simulating Urban Systems at the School of Geography (2019-2021), and before 
    joining the University of Leeds, Patricia also worked as an physics
    undergraduate professor at Federal Institute Catarinense-Brazil (2018-2019).
