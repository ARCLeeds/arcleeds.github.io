Occasionally, we get requests in about issues installing geospatial R packages on our HPC systems. These are big geospatial packages like [sf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html) or [terra](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/terra/index.html) that are fantastic libraries that have dependencies on big geospatial system libraries. 

One way to solve this is to use the [conda package manager](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) to install these geospatial libraries as well as using it to install R itself. One advantage is using conda to manage your R installation is that it any R packages installed will also be installed within our R environment helping us separate out R packages into distinct projects controlled by the conda environment. 

Letâ€™s imagine we want to install terra a spatial data analysis package that is the successor to the [raster](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/index.html) package and [sf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html) the simple features package for encoding spatial vector data. These are big spatial packages that require libraries like udunits2, gdal, geos and proj as well as having C++ components that need to be compiled. 

We can use conda to specifically create an environment into which we install these libraries as well as install a specific version of R we want to use.
It's important here that we use conda to also manage our R installation to ensure that the right compiler tools are also added to our conda environment to make sure that when compiling R packages that use C++ the same compiler toolchain is used.

> One issue i've seen on ARC4 is people trying to mix using the anaconda module and the R module. This always leads to problems because of the different compiler toolchains that have been used.

So let's get to business, on ARC4 lets install this package! 

```bash
# add the anaconda module to get access to the conda CLI
module add anaconda
# create a conda environment called gwmodel
# and install 3 packages from the conda forge channel
conda create -n r-geo -c conda-forge r-base=4.1.1 gdal=3 udunits2

# activate the environment to use the packages you've installed
source activate r-geo

# Install packages in R without starting an R console
(gwmodel) R -e 'install.packages("terra");' 
```

## Spack/Apptainer alternative

You could decide that you wanted to create a container with this package
included instead.

[Spack](https://spack.io/) is a package manager for supercomputers, that can
also help you build containers.  [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/) is the
most widely used container system for HPCs.

The Conda approach is definitely more straightforward, but there are
potentially performance advantages to the Spack route, with it using a
compressed image that takes up less space on disk, and also a single file,
which contrasts with the ~50k files likely with the Conda approach.  This is
particularly true if you're using a Lustre filesystem, that performs poorly
with large numbers of files.

It's also easier to archive on OneDrive, to share with other people, or
transfer onto other systems.

### Method

```bash
# Load the necessary anaconda (for Python) and apptainer modules
module add anaconda/2022.05 apptainer/1.1.6

# Write out a config file defining the container we want
cat > spack.yaml << EOB
spack:
  specs:
  - gdal@3
  - r@4.1.1
  - r-codetools
  - r-terra

  container:
    format: singularity
    images:
      os: "ubuntu:22.04"
      spack: develop
    os_packages:
      final:
      - libgomp1
      - libgfortran5
      - locales-all
EOB

# Install a copy of Spack
git clone https://github.com/spack/spack
# Enable Spack
. spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh 
# Generate a container definition file
spack containerize > r-geo.def
# Built it into a SIF file
apptainer build r-geo.sif r-geo.def

# You can delete the files we no longer need
rm -rf spack r-geo.def spack.yaml
```

This single file we've generated can now be used, e.g:

```bash
apptainer run r-geo.sif Rscript ./test.R
```

I don't think there's a right or wrong answer to problems like this, and it's
nice to have options.
