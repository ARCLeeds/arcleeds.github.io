On Thursday 13th October we celebrate International RSE Day 2022! 
The International RSE Day is to celebrate Research Software Engineers around the world and raise awareness for the increasingly relevant discipline of Research Software Engineering. 
And as a team of RSEs within Research Computing we've taken a few minutes to reflect on what it's like being an RSE at Leeds.

> Having come from a research background working as an RSE has given me fantastic opportunities to develop my software engineering skills supporting an incredible variety of projects and use cases. It's also been a fantastic chance to get involved in the computational community we have at Leeds and share and advocate for best practice concepts such as git and testing.
