### HPC0: Introduction to Linux

- Tuesday 3rd October 9:30am-12:30pm (Online)

This is a hands-on workshop intended as an introduction to the Linux command line and shell scripting. The purpose of the workshop is to give users the Linux skills to be able to handle data and files, run programs and automate workflows on a PC and on the HPC service. The content of this workshop is equally suited for people who wish to use command line Linux on a PC, in the Cloud or on a HPC platform. New and prospective HPC users are advised to take this workshop before taking the HPC1: Introduction to High Performance Computing at Leeds workshop.

### SWD6: High Performance Python

- Friday 13rd October 10:00am-4:00pm (In-Person)

Over the past few years, Python and the wider Python ecosystem have become invaluable tools in scientific computing and data analytics. As Python is (for the most part) an interpreted language there are complaints that Python code can be quite slow to execute. In this hands-on workshop you will have the opportunity discover and use a set of tools and techniques that can be used to improve the execution speed of your Python code. The workshop will introduce a number of ways to both measure the efficiency of your code and improve its speed of execution by introducing strategies for fast and scalable computation with Python.

### SWD2: Version Control with Git and GitHub

- Friday 10th November 10am-4pm (In-Person)

Version control can be thought of as the lab notebook of the digital world: it’s what professional software developers and authors use to keep track of what they’ve done and to collaborate with other people. Every large software development project relies on it, and most programmers use it for their small jobs as well. It isn’t just for software: books, papers, small data sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and should be stored in a version control system.

### SWD3: Software development practices for Research

- Tuesday 21st November 10am-4pm (In-Person)

The purpose of this workshop is to introduce a number of the techniques and concepts that professional software developers use to manage their code, projects and teams. Although the development of research codes and software has different needs and challenges to the development of commercial software, there are nonetheless some tools and techniques that we can adopt or adopt to improve our Research Software Engineering. This isn’t a programming workshop, so it will be relevant to you whichever programming language (on Windows, Linux or Mac) or infrastructure (HPC, Cloud, Desktop) you use. This will be a hands-on session with lots of discussion and small group activities. We’ll be joined by a number of people who develop codes and software who will share their experiences.
