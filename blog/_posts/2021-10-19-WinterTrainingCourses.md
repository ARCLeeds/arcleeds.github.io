### HPC0: Introduction to Linux (Online)

- Tuesday 2nd November 9am till 12.30pm

This is a hands-on workshop intended as an introduction to the Linux command line and shell scripting. It is suitable for Linux, Unix and Mac OSX users. The purpose of the workshop is to give users the Linux skills to be able to handle data and files, run programs and automate workflows on a PC and on the HPC service. The content of this workshop is equally suited for people who wish to use command line Linux on a PC, in the Cloud or on a HPC platform. New and prospective HPC users are advised to take this workshop before taking the HPC1: Introduction to High Performance Computing at Leeds workshop.

### SWD2: Version Control with Git and GitHub

- Thursday 11th November 9am-12pm

- Thursday 18th November 9am-12pm

Version control can be thought of as the lab notebook of the digital world: it's what professional software developers and authors use to keep track of what they've done and to collaborate with other people. Every large software development project relies on it, and most programmers use it for their small jobs as well. It isn't just for software: books, papers, small data sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and should be stored in a version control system. This course is split over two days, **please do not apply for this course unless you are able to attend ALL the sessions**.
