Christmas is around the corner so help us showcase the fantastic work of our amazing HPC user community by participating in 12 days of HPC! This is our festive-themed blog series we've run for the past two years where users submit a blog entry about their work using the HPC and we format and publish one (or more) post each day in December, like an HPC-related advent calendar treat!

Why not let us showcase your amazing research on our blog by completing the [submission form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=qO3qvR3IzkWGPlIypTW3y7U8gIAi6LpMg7rjkJ9mZ3tUNU5TNEFXTVBGVDJKNk1QTFZLQ0VPVTBaNi4u) by 5pm Friday 25th November.

Weâ€™ll format entries and add one new post every day during December to the blog page on our [website](https://arc.leeds.ac.uk/blog/), and share it via our [Twitter page](https://twitter.com/RC_at_Leeds) and via our mailing lists.

So please get involved and help contribute to 12 Days of HPC!
