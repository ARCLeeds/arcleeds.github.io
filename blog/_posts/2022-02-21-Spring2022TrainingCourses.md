This is a hands-on workshop intended as an introduction to the Linux command line and shell scripting. It is suitable for Linux, Unix and Mac OSX users. The purpose of the workshop is to give users the Linux skills to be able to handle data and files, run programs and automate workflows on a PC and on the HPC service. The content of this workshop is equally suited for people who wish to use command line Linux on a PC, in the Cloud or on a HPC platform. New and prospective HPC users are advised to take this workshop before taking the HPC1: Introduction to High Performance Computing at Leeds workshop.

### HPC1: HPC Carpentry

- Tuesday 15th March 9am-12pm

- Tuesday 22nd March 9am-12pm

This workshop is designed to introduce new users to the High Performance Computing (HPC) service at Leeds. It will be useful if you are new to HPC in research or have used HPC elsewhere. It is suitable for researchers from all faculties and examples will be given from a range of research domains. The purpose of the workshop is to give users the skills to be an effective user of the HPC service and to get codes and applications running effectively. This course is split over two sessions a week apart, **please do not apply for this course unless you are able to attend ALL the sessions**.

### SWD2: Version Control with Git and GitHub

- Thursday 21st April 1pm-4pm

- Thursday 28th April 1pm-4pm

Version control can be thought of as the lab notebook of the digital world: it's what professional software developers and authors use to keep track of what they've done and to collaborate with other people. Every large software development project relies on it, and most programmers use it for their small jobs as well. It isn't just for software: books, papers, small data sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and should be stored in a version control system. This course is split over two sessions a week apart, **please do not apply for this course unless you are able to attend ALL the sessions**.

There are limited spaces for these courses so if you are unable to book on you can still join the priority waiting list so you are contacted when we next run the training course.

## May 2022

### SWD3: Software development practices for Research

- Thursday 12th November 1pm-4pm

- Thursday 19th November 1pm-4pm

The purpose of this workshop is to introduce a number of the techniques and concepts that professional software developers use to manage their code, projects and teams. Although the development of research codes and software has different needs and challenges to the development of commercial software, there are nonetheless some tools and techniques that we can adopt or adopt to improve our Research Software Engineering. This isn’t a programming workshop, so it will be relevant to you whichever programming language (on Windows, Linux or Mac) or infrastructure (HPC, Cloud, Desktop) you use. This will be a hands-on session with lots of discussion and small group activities. We’ll be joined by a number of people who develop codes and software who will share their experiences. This course is split over two sessions a week apart, **please do not apply for this course unless you are able to attend ALL the sessions**.
