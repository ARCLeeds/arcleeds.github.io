## June 2023

### HPC0: Introduction to Linux (Online)

- Thursday 22nd June 9:30am-12:30pm

This is a hands-on workshop intended as an introduction to the Linux command line and shell scripting. It is suitable for Linux, Unix and Mac OSX users. The purpose of the workshop is to give users the Linux skills to be able to handle data and files, run programs and automate workflows on a PC and on the HPC service. The content of this workshop is equally suited for people who wish to use command line Linux on a PC, in the Cloud or on a HPC platform. New and prospective HPC users are advised to take this workshop before taking the HPC1: Introduction to High Performance Computing at Leeds workshop.

### HPC1: HPC Carpentry (Online)

- Thursday 29th June 9:30am-12:30pm
- Thursday 6th July 9:30am-12:30pm

This workshop is designed to introduce new users to the High Performance Computing (HPC) service at Leeds. It will be useful if you are new to HPC in research or have used HPC elsewhere. It is suitable for researchers from all faculties and examples will be given from a range of research domains. The purpose of the workshop is to give users the skills to be an effective user of the HPC service and to get codes and applications running effectively. This course is split over two sessions a week apart, **please do not apply for this course unless you are able to attend ALL the sessions**.

### SWD6: High Performance Python (Online)

- Thursday 27th June 10:00am-4:00pm

Over the past few years, Python and the wider Python ecosystem have become invaluable tools in scientific computing and data analytics. As Python is (for the most part) an interpreted language there are complaints that Python code can be quite slow to execute. In this hands-on workshop you will have the opportunity discover and use a set of tools and techniques that can be used to improve the execution speed of your Python code. The workshop will introduce a number of ways to both measure the efficiency of your code and improve its speed of execution by introducing strategies for fast and scalable computation with Python.

At the end of this workshop, learners will be able to:

1. Understand how to profile Python code and identify bottlenecks
2. Understand how to choose the most appropriate data structure, algorithm, and libraries for a problem
3. Improve the execution time of Python code using:  
    - Vectorisation (with [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/ufuncs.html))  
    - Compilers (with [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/))  
    - Parallelisation (with [Dask](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/) and [Ray](https://www.ray.io/))  
    - GPUs (with [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), [CUDA/Numba](https://developer.nvidia.com/how-to-cuda-python), and [RAPIDS](https://developer.nvidia.com/rapids))  
4. Understand when to use each technique

N.B. This course has recently been updated and course contents may change at the time of delivery.
