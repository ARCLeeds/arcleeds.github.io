We've now confirmed some upcoming training courses which are now open for registrations! 

Whether you want to learn some Git, Linux command line or learn more about the University's high performance computing systems we've got a course for you.

Currently our courses are all still virtual workshops run online via Teams with course materials available online. They are hands-on so be prepared to do some typing!

Find booking links on the course web pages below.

## February 2023

### HPC0: Introduction to Linux (Online)

- Tuesday 7th February 9.30am till 12.30pm

This is a hands-on workshop intended as an introduction to the Linux command line and shell scripting. It is suitable for Linux, Unix and Mac OSX users. The purpose of the workshop is to give users the Linux skills to be able to handle data and files, run programs and automate workflows on a PC and on the HPC service. The content of this workshop is equally suited for people who wish to use command line Linux on a PC, in the Cloud or on a HPC platform. New and prospective HPC users are advised to take this workshop before taking the HPC1: Introduction to High Performance Computing at Leeds workshop.

### HPC1: HPC Carpentry

- Tuesday 14th February 9.30am-12.30pm
- Tuesday 21st February 9.30am-12.30pm

This workshop is designed to introduce new users to the High Performance Computing (HPC) service at Leeds. It will be useful if you are new to HPC in research or have used HPC elsewhere. It is suitable for researchers from all faculties and examples will be given from a range of research domains. The purpose of the workshop is to give users the skills to be an effective user of the HPC service and to get codes and applications running effectively. This course is split over two sessions a week apart, **please do not apply for this course unless you are able to attend ALL the sessions**.

### SWD2: Version Control with Git and GitHub (In person)

- Tuesday 7th March 10am-4pm

Version control can be thought of as the lab notebook of the digital world: it's what professional software developers and authors use to keep track of what they've done and to collaborate with other people. Every large software development project relies on it, and most programmers use it for their small jobs as well. It isn't just for software: books, papers, small data sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and should be stored in a version control system.

### SWD1a: Introduction to Python programming (In person)

* Wednesday 29th March 10am-4pm
* Wednesday 30th March 10am-4pm

This is an introduction to programming in Python for people with little or no previous programming experience. It uses plotting and visualising data as its motivating example based on an established research dataset. The course is suitable for attendees from all research domains and we will use a Web based programming environment (a Jupyter Notebook) which means you will be able to apply the ideas you learn on the course straightaway without having to install any software at home or at work. This course is running as 2 all day sessions delivered in person on campus. **Please do not apply for this course unless you are able to attend ALL the sessions.**

At the end of the workshop, attendees will be able to:

* How to run Python programs
* Storing data in computer programs (using variables and data types)
* Using built in functions in programs
* Avoiding and fixing errors in programs
* Using software other people have written (libraries)
* Reading tabular data and simple statistical analysis
* Plotting data
* Storing multiple values using lists
* Repeating things using LOOPS
* Creating functions
* Making programs do different things for different data (Conditionals: IF statements)
* Writing simple tests: making sure our programs behave properly
* Programming style
